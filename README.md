This repository contains a collection of architecture and design diagrams for implementing **Agentic AI** in the **insurance domain** using **Amazon Bedrock** and supporting AWS services.

These diagrams are intended to guide technical teams, solution architects, and AI/ML strategists in designing scalable, secure, and explainable agentic workflows that integrate with existing enterprise systems.

## 📌 What’s Included

### 1. High-Level Architecture Diagram

A layered view of the proposed Agentic AI solution stack:

* **User Interface Layer**: Web portals, chatbots, call center UIs
* **Agentic AI Runtime**: Amazon Bedrock with Bedrock Agents
* **Messaging Backbone**: EventBridge and Amazon SQS
* **Asynchronous Processors**: AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and containerized workers
* **Data & AI Layer**: S3, OpenSearch, Kendra, DynamoDB, and optionally SageMaker
* **Enterprise System Integration**: Core systems like PAS, CRM, CMS, ERP
* **Security & Monitoring**: IAM, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, CloudWatch, Config

---

### 2. Agent-Level Design Diagrams

Each agent has its own dedicated design diagram showing internal subflows and AWS service interactions:

* **🟨 Customer Interaction Agent**
* **🟫 Supervisor Agent**
* **🟩 Underwriting Agent**
* **🟦 Policy Issuance Agent**
* **🟪 Claims Triage Agent**
* **🟥 Policy Validation Agent**
* **🟧 Fraud Detection Agent**


Each diagram includes:

* Bedrock Action Groups and Lambda flows
* Connections to knowledge base (OpenSearch, S3)
* APIs to PAS, CRM, and other internal systems
* Optional integrations like e-signature, notifications, and audit trail

### 3. Multi-Agent Interaction Diagram

A high-level workflow diagram that visualizes how user interactions are routed and handled in the Agentic AI ecosystem.

Entry Points: Users initiate requests via phone calls, chatbots, or service portals (e.g., ticketing systems).

Customer Interaction Agent: Serves as the initial conversational interface to understand intent and capture inputs.

Supervisor Agent: Acts as the central coordinator that interprets the request type and delegates it to the appropriate downstream agent:

Underwriting Agent

Policy Issuance Agent

Claims Triage Agent

Policy Validation Agent

Fraud Detection Agent

This diagram helps convey the overall orchestration and routing logic, not internal workflows or HITL delegation.

## 💡 How to Use

These diagrams can be adapted for:

* Proof-of-concept development
* Enterprise architecture planning
* RFP responses or technical evaluations
* Regulatory and audit preparation
* Cost and performance benchmarking

## 📈 Potential Business Outcomes

Expected outcomes may vary by organization, but typical objectives include:

* ✅ Reducing claim and policy processing cycle times
* ✅ Automating Tier-1 customer and agent interactions
* ✅ Enhancing fraud detection and underwriting accuracy
* ✅ Improving auditability and explainability for regulatory compliance
* ✅ Streamlining knowledge access and decisioning with centralized AI agents
